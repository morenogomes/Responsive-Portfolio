About my CSS Framework homework.

For this assignment, I’ve used CSS, Bootstrap, Media Query and Google Fonts.

The complete portfolio has 3 pages. An index.html wich contains infos about me, portfolio.html wich contains projects I have accomplished, contact.html to get in touch with me, style.css for 
styling.

A Bootstrap framework was applied to make a container, rows and columns with images.
Images are stored inside the images folder and also linked to the web. 

I’ve done many modifications throughout the time to get closer to what I had in mind and I left some not functional (commented)  codes so I can get access to them in the future.

The navbar contains links to the 3 different pages.

Semantic html is applied.

I’ve linked my pages to the google fonts page, so I can style my written content.

Media query is applied to make the pages responsive to mobile devices. 

A sicky footer was added on the bottom. 

I’m not really sure if I described enough here but I want to keep it simple and short.
